title: "Working with LEHD Worker Flow Data"
output: html_notebook
---

This notebook will porocess the LEHD Worker Flow data and place the cleaned results into the Central Database. This notebook combines both R and Python code. This first code chunk uses python to create a datframe to import in Elmer and then uses R to replace the table in the Central Database.

```{r write_to_db, include = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
library(odbc)

# Run python code that processes data for import to elmer
source_python("lehd-workers-to-elmer.py")
worker_flow <- create_worker_flow_df(2005,2015)

# SQL Database Connection settings
elmer_connection <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
  driver = "SQL Server",
  server = "sql2016\\DSADEV",
  database = "Sandbox",
  trusted_connection = "yes"
  )

# Clean up Data Types in the dataframe before it is pushed to the database
cols <- c('record_id','home_fips','year','value')
worker_flow[cols] <- lapply(worker_flow[cols], as.integer)

# Now write data to Elmer
dbWriteTable(elmer_connection, "lehd_otm_county_workers", worker_flow, overwrite=TRUE)
dbDisconnect(elmer_connection)

```
