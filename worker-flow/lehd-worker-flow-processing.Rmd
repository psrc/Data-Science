This notebook will porocess the LEHD Worker Flow data and place the cleaned results into the Central Database. This notebook combines both R and Python code. This first code chunk uses python to create a datframe to import in Elmer.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
library(odbc)
use_condaenv("r-reticulate")

# Run python code that processes data for import to elmer
source_python("lehd-workers-to-elmer.py")
worker_flow <- create_worker_flow_df()

# SQL Database Connection settings
elmer_connection <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
  driver = "SQL Server",
  server = "sql2016\\DSADEV",
  database = "Sandbox",
  trusted_connection = "yes"
  )

# Now write data to Elmer
dbWriteTable(elmer_connection, "lehd_otm_county_workers", as.data.frame(worker_flow), overwrite=TRUE)
dbDisconnect(elmer_connection)

```
