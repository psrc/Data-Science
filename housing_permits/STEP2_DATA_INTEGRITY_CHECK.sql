TASK: 
this script is to modify the duplicated records, where current year is duplicated with previour years record.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
reasons for duplicated records are vaiours. 
One of it could be some pemits issued in preciou years are finalized in current year. so we want to update the previous year to latest year. and delete the previous records.
Another reason could be permit filer want to update some part of permit (unit numbers, value, housing type...); so we want to capture this. 

MY SCRIPTING LOGIC:
1: query to update columns: delete,  oldpermit.check, newpermit.check
2: select "yes" in new record portion, if all columns are updated
3: if select "yes" in old record portion, if the record is duplicated with the new ones; query through -  issue date, unit, sortid(maybe)
4: check the rows, which have two yeses. update the old record to new ones, 
   NOTICE: AT this point, do not simply delete the old records! 
           please modify the record by combining the most accurate info from old to one! some times old record could be more valuable than new ones. 
5: check yes, in the old records (or maybe new records), after combined the information to the other rows.
