Create objects from database:
	dictSummaryLevels #summary levels to be downloaded
	dictVariables #Census variables to be downloaded
	dictCounties #ID codes for the four counties we will be downloading data for
	dfGeographicUnits #list of every individual geographic unit at various summary levels within the four counties
	
	Download tract data:
		for each CensusFile in dictDataFiles:
			CensusFileID = dictDataFiles[CensusFile] for each variable in dictVariables:
				VarID <- the numeric value for variable
				for each county in dictCounties:
					dfRawTractData <- county-tract-level data
					join dfRawTractData:
						with dfGeographicUnits on county and tract to get LogicalRecID
					dfSummaryData < dfRawTractData [CensusFileID, VarID, LogicalRecID, Estimate]
